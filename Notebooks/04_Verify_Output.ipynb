(of course! my fav!) gina goes to live in shelley beach after her hubby announces he wants a divorce (of course! so cliched! but somehow i got past this!). she agrees to housesit adrian's house. as such she inherits not only his dog, but also his position in the shelly beach writers' group and is expected to organise their meetings. adrian and gina correspond via email and phone calls which are all quite funny with gina's internal thoughts added. there's also a nice handsome younger man who gina thinks could help with her confidence after the hubby dumping and a nice handsome older man who doesn't particularly like her house-owner, adrian. yes, yes, all cliched, but i still loved it. :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |eng          |0      |2012-07-09    |3.22           |9                   |3.22             |10                |151               |64.22             |\n",
